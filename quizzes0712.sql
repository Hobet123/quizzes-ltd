Summative assessment is better to test with an exam, because you\'re testing what students have learned during the entire instruction. Formative assessment measures small parts of the instruction and quizzes are a good way to test that.\r\n\r\nHow good are you at weighing situations? From decision oriented evaluation, experimental research, and politically controlled evaluation, to name a few; we have quizzes on different approaches of evaluation, just for you.
